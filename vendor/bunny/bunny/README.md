> Performant pure-PHP AMQP (RabbitMQ) sync/async (ReactPHP) library

## Requirements

BunnyPHP requires PHP `>= 5.4.0`.

## Installation

Add as [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency:

```sh
$ composer require bunny/bunny:@dev
```

## Comparison

You might ask if there isn't a library/extension to connect to AMQP broker (e.g. RabbitMQ) already. Yes, there are
 multiple options:
 
- [ext-amqp](http://pecl.php.net/package/amqp) - PHP extension
- [php-amqplib](https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib) - pure-PHP AMQP protocol implementation
- [react-amqp](https://github.com/JCook21/ReactAMQP) - ext-amqp binding to ReactPHP  

Why should you want to choose BunnyPHP instead?

* You want **nice idiomatic PHP API** to work with (I'm looking at you, php-amqplib). BunnyPHP interface follows PHP's common
  **coding standards** and **naming conventions**. See tutorial.
  
* You **can't (don't want to) install PECL extension** that has latest stable version in 2014. BunnyPHP isn't as such marked
  as stable yet. But it is already being used in production.
  
* You have **both classic CLI/FPM and [ReactPHP](http://reactphp.org/)** applications and need to connect to RabbitMQ. 
  BunnyPHP comes with both **synchronous and asynchronous** clients with same PHP-idiomatic interface. Async client uses
  [react/promise](https://github.com/reactphp/promise).

Apart from that BunnyPHP is more performant than main competing library, php-amqplib. See [`benchmark/` directory](https://github.com/jakubkulhan/bunny/tree/master/benchmark)
and [php-amqplib's `benchmark/`](https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib/tree/master/benchmark).

Benchmarks were run as:

```sh
$Â php benchmark/producer.php N & php benchmark/consumer.php
```

## Tutorial

TODO, see `benchmarks/` for basic use.

## Contributing

* Large part of the PHP code (almost everything in `Bunny\Protocol` namespace) is generated from spec in file
  [`spec/amqp-rabbitmq-0.9.1.json`](spec/amqp-rabbitmq-0.9.1.json). Look for `DO NOT EDIT!` in doc comments.

  To change geneted files change [`spec/generate.php`](spec/generate.php) and run:

  ```sh
  $ php ./spec/generate.php
  ```
